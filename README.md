# Hybrid-nongreedy-asynchronous-clustering-H-NAC

2022-05-07

This is a simple MATLAB implementation of the basic version of the clustering algorithm (called Hybrid-nongreedy-asynchronous-clustering-H-NAC) presented in the following paper (open access):

Z. Uykan, "Fusion of Centroid-Based Clustering With Graph Clustering: An Expectation-Maximization-Based Hybrid Clustering," in IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, November 2021. DOI: 10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3121224.

Because this is a basic MATLAB implementation without any code optimization concerns, we recommend you to write your own MATLAB code from scratch once you get the idea of the H-NAC. Writing your own MATLAB code of the basic H-NAC should not take more than one hour.
